<p>You end up spending a couple hours looking up spooky scary stuff about vampires.</p>

<p>You also begin to notice some uncomfortable similarities between internet vampires and yur roommate. He's a weirdo, but a bonafide Dracula? No way. Those aren't real. They can't be.</p>

<p>Maybe you should confront your fears head on and watch a scary movie about Draculas. Then they won't seem so scary, right? It is pretty late though... Maybe you should get up?</p>
