    <p>You know what, maybe this won't be so bad? You obviously haven't been killed yet, so he can't want to hurt you, right?</p>

    <p>You continue to live with Kristof, gradually getting ued to his weird behavior. It's almost becoming endearing in a way.</p>

    <p>At this point, you know he's a vampire, he knows you know he's a vampire. The two of you go on to lead as normal as a life as you could possibly have.</p>
