    <p>After the unexpected desertion my roommate I was forced with the task of finding a subletter for his room. After placing the craigslist ad, I received dozens of responses… However, only one persona showed up to see the apartment. His name is Kristof, and he’s very odd. Extremely secretive and foreign. Refuses to tell me anything about him, but given the turnout of finding someone to sublet the room, I was out of options. Kristof keeps to himself for the most part, but the longer I live with him, the more I feel uncomfortable around him. Something about him isn’t quite right…
    </p>

    <p>I can’t help but zone out when reflecting upon the events of this past month as prepare my cereal in the morning… Suddenly I feel an ice cold presence behind me. The hair on the back of my neck pricks up as I have become fully aware that I am not in the kitchen by myself. </p>

    <p>“Kristof..?” I say turning my head to face him. However, this man does not look like Kristof. It does, resemble him, but the monster before me is fearsome, with a ravenous look in it’s eyes and vampire fangs. The monster reacts quickly to my every movement. I attempt to flee only to be caught ensnared quickly in the monster’s claw-like hands. As the monster grabs hold my shoulders, it sinks it’s monstrous fangs in my jugular.
    </p>

    <p>Suddenly I am woken by the familiar sound of my alarm clock.</p>

    <p>It’s 10am, and it’s my day off. I can’t help but think back to that awful dream. Was it a monster? Or was it Kristof? Dreams are weird. </p>

    <p>I’m still feeling pretty groggy but I could probably go for some breakfast…</p>
