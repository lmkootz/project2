    <p>After the unexpected desertion of your roommate, you were forced with the task of fidning a subletter for his room. After placing the craigslist ad, you recieved dozens of reposnses however, none have successfully turned up to interview. None, except one person; A very odd, foreign man by the name of Kristof.</p>

    <p>You notice over the course of the next week, Kristof is not just odd, he's VERY odd.</p>

    <p>But that's neither here or there.</p>


    <p>Right now, you are standing in your kitchen, staring out the window while pouring some cereal. The hair stands up on the back of your neck and you begin to realize you are not alone.</p>

    <p>"Kristof..?" you call out while turning slightly to greet him.</p>

    <p>However, as you turn, it is not your roommate standing in front of you, but rather a hideous monster with glowing eyes and giant fangs. In some way he does resemble your roommate, but this isn't really the time for questions.</p>

    <p>Yeah this thing is definitely a Dracula or something. Seeing as your apartment is seriously laking in the wooden stake department. The monster grabs hold of you and tears sinto your jugular, and you begin to black out.
    </p>

    <p>Suddenly, you are woken up to familiar noise of your alarm clock.</p>

    <p>It’s 10am, and it’s your day off. You can’t help but think back to that awful dream. Was it a monster? Or was it Kristof? Dreams are weird. </p>

    <p>You're still feeling pretty tired and groggy, but maybe breakfast would be a better idea...</p>
