    <p>This is crazy.</p>

    <p>Bats?? There are bats in your apartment??? This guy is a lunatic. There's no way you can stay here. But you can't kick him out either who knows what he would do to you. Wouldn't it be easier just to pass this madness on someone else? You stare out the kitchenwindow pensively and think about your predicament.</p>
