   <p>Yeah, you know what? Today is your day and you should enjoy it.</p>
<p>You begin to doze off to sleep and have a really weird dream about a vampire that moonlights as a private detective in Norway. This dream was certainly a lot less scary than the first one, but you're beginning to notice a disturbing pattern in your subconscious. </p>

<p>Just then, you are awoken to the sound on your doorbell. You kind of hope they'll just go away, but they keep ringing it over and over again. You are extremely irritated by their persistance but it could be important. </p>

<p>Maybe I should get that?</p>
