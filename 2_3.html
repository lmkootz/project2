    <p>I rush to the front door to find a mysterious stranger holding out a package.</p>

      <p>“You sign here” he says and pushes a scrap of paper and fountain pen into my hands. I scrawl my name on the paper and he snatches it from my hands, and huffs away. </p>

      <p>The mysterious stranger has a weird accent like Kristof. What a small world.</p>

      <p>I’m left with an unmarked package, with what could be shipping labels written in a strange language. I don’t think this went through USPS… Maybe I should investigate.
      </p>
