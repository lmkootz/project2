    <p>The doorbell rings and you rush to the front door to find a mysterious stranger holding out a package.</p>

      <p>“You sign here” he says and pushes a scrap of paper and fountain pen into your hands. You scrawl my name on the paper and he snatches it from your hands, and huffs away. </p>

      <p>That mysterious stranger had a weird accent like Kristof. What a small world.</p>

      <p>Now you're left with an unmarked package, with what could be shipping labels written in a strange language. It doesn't look like it went through USPS… Maybe you should investigate...
