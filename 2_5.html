    <p>Though it's awfully tempting to look into the private mail of your roommate is pretty tempting, you'll have to make due with shaking the box and guessing what's inside.</p> 

    <p>Whether it actually went through an official mailing service or not shouldn't matter, it
    s probably still illegal to open someone else's mail.  You should really leave that package for Kristof.</p>

    <p>His door is slightly ajar, just enough to get a little bit of a peek. But not quite enough to satiate your curiousity.</p>

    <p>It wouldn't hurt to just take a quick look inside would it, right?</p>
